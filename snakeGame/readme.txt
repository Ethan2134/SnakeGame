SNAKE

This is a game of snake created in NetBeans using Java Swing. The objective of this game is to eat as many apples as
possible, without eating yourself or running into the wall. Hitting yourself or the wall will result in the game ending.
To move, use WSAD. The score is kept at the top of the screen. The source code and an executable JAR is included under the
'dist' folder.
